# Input variables
# P_AUDIO_IN
# X_KEYWORDS (non-blocking)
# P_OVERRIDE

# Output variables
# P_AUDIO_OUT

# First iteration
Use read only RAM (should be 12 entries)

  TODO: Use gates for blocking?

1 controller for forwarding audio unless X is set
  then handling override to reset

1 controller to compare NLP and send matching X signal

## Exploration

- 1 DX300 for override button (not enough pins on final)
- NLP compare (MC6000 for dev)
- Audio proxy (MC6000 for dev)

NLP compare

```
# Read from non-blocking NLP
mov x1 dat

# If we have nothing new, treat it as dummy keyword
# TODO: We can prob ditch these lines and always double read
teq dat -999
+ mov 0 x2
+ jmp SLEEP

# Trigger switch (assume keywords were spoilers)
# TODO: Read from RAM
mov 100 x2

# Sleep
SLEEP: slp 1
```

Audio proxy

```
# Wait for signal (blocks until NLP check completes)
SLEEP: slx x1

# If override button is pressed (using DX300)
teq x0 100
  # Reset spoiler flag
+ mov 0 acc

# If spoiler trigger was fired
teq x1 100
  # Set + hold audio at 50
+ mov 50 p1
  # Set spoiler flag to prevent further actions
+ mov 100 acc

# If spoiler flag is off, then forward audio (unsets 50 too)
teq acc 100
- mov p0 p1
```

## Solution

Same concept as above

NLP compare

```
# Save ACC and DAT
mov x3 acc
mov x3 dat

# Jump to position 0 in RAM
mov 0 x1

LOOP:
# If we match these keywords
teq acc x0
+ teq dat x0
  # Send a trigger
+ mov 100 x2
  # Stop looping
+ jmp SLEEP

# If we reached the end (i.e. no triggers)
teq x1 12
  # Send 0 signal
+ mov 0 x2

  # Otherwise, loop
- jmp LOOP

# Sleep
SLEEP: slp 1
```

```
# Wait for signal (blocks until NLP check completes)
SLEEP: slx x0

# If override button is pressed (using DX300)
teq x1 001
  # Reset spoiler flag
+ mov 0 acc

# If spoiler trigger was fired
teq x0 100
  # Set + hold audio at 50
+ mov 50 p1
  # Set spoiler flag to prevent further actions
+ mov 100 acc

# If spoiler flag is off, then forward audio (unsets 50 too)
teq acc 100
- mov p0 p1
```

TODO: Clever solution by ADD and SUB packets
  then SUB and ADD then verify 0
  Nah, won't work as we lose track of ACC

TODO: Power optimiation by sleeping on -999

-----

Optimized

```
# Save first packet
mov x3 acc

# If it's -999, treat it as no match (jump to loop end)
teq acc -999
+ jmp END_LOOP

# Save second packet
mov x3 dat

# If we match these keywords
teq acc x0
+ teq dat x0
  # Send a trigger
+ mov 100 x2
  # Stop looping
+ jmp SLEEP

  # Send 0 signal
+ mov 0 x2

# If aren't at the end, loop
teq x1 12
- jmp LOOP

# Signal that we made no matches
END_LOOP: mov 0 x2
SLEEP: slp 1
```

Audio proxy is same as before

TODO: Maybe there's something where we only store/compare differences
  but I really don't want to explore that...
