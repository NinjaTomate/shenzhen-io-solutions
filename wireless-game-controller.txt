# Input variables
# P_X
# P_Y
# P_A
# P_B
# X_RADIO_RX

# Output values
# X_RADIO_TX

# Gist
When we get X_RADIO_RX
Run logic on P_A and P_B
Send data [P_X, P_Y, CALC_A_B] to X_RADIO_TX

# Requirements
# DEV: Explored visually on board
1 MC6000 for 2X (radio) + 2P (buttons) + 1X (other calcs)
1 MC4000 for 2P (2 buttons) -> 1X (other calcs)

# Fine grained gist
# Controller 1 (MC6000)
# Wait for rx signal

# Write out X and Y

# Write to Controller 2 for data

# Read from Controller 2 and write to data

# Controller 2 (MC4000)
# Wait for signal from Controller 1

# Calculate and write value to Controller 1
