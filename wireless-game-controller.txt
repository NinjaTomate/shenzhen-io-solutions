# Input variables
# P_X
# P_Y
# P_A
# P_B
# X_RADIO_RX

# Output values
# X_RADIO_TX

# Gist
When we get X_RADIO_RX
Run logic on P_A and P_B
Send data [P_X, P_Y, CALC_A_B] to X_RADIO_TX

# Requirements
# DEV: Explored visually on board
1 MC6000 for 2X (radio) + 2P (buttons) + 2X (other calcs)
1 MC4000 for 2P (2 buttons) -> 2X (other calcs)

# Fine grained gist
# Controller 1 (MC6000)
# Check for signal
# DEV: Cannot wait for signal due to -999

# Write out X and Y

# Write to Controller 2 for data

# Read from Controller 2 and write to data

# Controller 2 (MC4000)
# Wait for signal from Controller 1

# Calculate and write value to Controller 1

Code:

```
# If have signal
teq x0 -1
# Write X/Y
+ mov p0 x1
+ mov p1 x1
# Ask/write A+B
+ mov 0 x2
+ mov x2 x1

# Sleep
slp 1
```

Hooray bitmasking \o/

```
# Wait for SIG
slx x0
# Reset + add
mov x0 acc
teq p0 100
+ add 1
teq p1 100
+ add 2
mov acc x0
```
