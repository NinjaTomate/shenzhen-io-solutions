# Input variables
X_ERROR
P_POWER
P_TEMP
P_CONTROL

# Output variables
X_DISPLAY

# Gist
Turn on parts of a display via number (e.g. 1 for compressor)
Turn off parts of a display via negative of number (e.g. -1 for compressor)
Turn off all parts via -999
If there's an error, pass unchanged number directly to display (these will be +n and -n when appropriate)

This seems really straight forward, I guess we'll get to coding and see what changes
  (e.g. if control rods need magic control logic)
    but they seem like range conversions...
