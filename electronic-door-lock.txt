## Concept
Save card info to RAM

On card reader
If LEARN === 100
  Write card reader to RAM
  (use RAM address as counter for 8 digits)
Else
  Verify card reader matches RAM

TODO: To accept hotel card, use 2 controllers and an OR gate?
  We will need to duplicate card reader info

Let's see how we do with no hotel support
  like lines...

Current variant

```
# Wait for signal
SLEEP: slx x0

# Reset RAM position to 0 (good for read and write)
mov 0 x3

# Reset comparator to 1
# TODO: Should be 100 and sub 100...
mov 1 acc

# Save LEARN vs VALIDATE status for looping
mov p0 dat
LOOP:

# If we are at the end of memory, go to start
teq x3 10
+ jmp SLEEP

# If we are LEARNing, write packet to RAM and LOOP
teq dat 100
+ mov x0 x2
+ jmp LOOP

# Otherwise, we are validating

# If the value is different, invalidate ourselves
# TODO: This should be sub 100
teq x0 x2
- sub 1

# If we are at the end of key
+ teq x3 10
TODO: Need to pulse unlock with ACC
  But -999 to 0 will be 0 and 100 will be 100 for UNLOCK :+1:

# Go to loop check
jmp LOOP
```
