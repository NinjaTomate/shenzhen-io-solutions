# Input variables
# X_RADIO_RX = [R_INTENSITY, G_INTENSITY, B_INTENSITY, DURATION]
# We will use R_INT, G_INT, B_INT for short

# Output variables
# P_LED_R
# P_LED_G
# P_LED_B

# Gist
# On acc, count down for pulse duration
# Leverage DX300 to persist X values (need to verify)
# When acc hits zero, flush DX300

# Explore
# Write digital input to DX300
# Sleep for a while

# Nope, no intensity preserved
# but maybe we can use p1 on microcontrollers

# Can we read different numbers from rx on 2 mc?
