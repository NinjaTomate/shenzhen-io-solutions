# Overview
Need to rolling average somehow...

Can we add 1 for each second over 50
  and subtract 1 each time?

Nope, they want an actual average

Here's our exploration

C1:

```
# If sensor is over 50
tgt p0 50
  # Add to our counter
+ add 1
# If we have 8 units collected
tgt p1 8
  # And we are above 0
+ tgt acc 0
  # Drop us down
+ sub 1
slp 1
```

C2:

```
# Count and export how long we have been running
add 1
mov acc p0
slp 1
```
