# Overview
On keypress
If track 1
  Turn on extrude
  Turn on/off valves for pattern + sleep
  Turn off extrude
  Turn off valves
Same for other tracks

# First thoughts
Save valve-0 + valve-1 in READ only RAM (e.g. [valve-0[0], valve-1[0], valve-0[1], valve-1[1], ...)
  Then use mirroring for type 1 and type 2
  TODO: We would need to write valve-0 track to register, is that okay?

Hmm, what if we store all the data? How big would that be?

Maybe jump to different addresses at start?
  14 / 3
  4.667
  so 4 parts per meat per RAM
  There are 7 * 3 meat parts = 21
  21 / 4 = 5.25 -> 6
  which means read only RAM
  I don't think we could get enough pins to that if we wanted.
  Get clever.

RAM techniques:

- valve-0 and valve-1 in same memory
  - Good but lots of equality checks

- valve-0 for type 1 and type 2 in same memory
  - Need to jump to different locations but that's easy (e.g. 2 lines, not equality)

For type 3, need to output it as is

We could prob even get more clever by not setting type 2 valve 0 as it's all the same
