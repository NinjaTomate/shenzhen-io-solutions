# Thoughts
- Need to save oracle data in memory somehow
    - Maybe directly to pins via DX300?

# Gist - Too bulky
3 controllers

Controller 1:

When button is pressed
  Send X signal to child #1
  Sleep 3
  Send X signal to child #2

Child 1:

When X signal
  Reset acc
  3 times
    DST set to ACC from oracle
    Sleep
  Sleep 3
  Flush to DX300

Child 2:

When X signal
  Reset acc
  3 times
    DST set to ACC from oracle
    Sleep
  No sleep (this is second half)
  Flush to DX300


# Gist - Too long for 1 controller
1 controller

If button is pressed
  Reset acc
  3 times
    DST set to ACC from oracle
    Sleep
  Flush to DX300 (already bad)
  Reset acc
  3 times
    DST set to ACC from oracle
    Sleep
  Flush to DX300 (already bad)
