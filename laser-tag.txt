# Input variables
# P_HIT
# P_RESPAWN
# P_TRIGGER
# P_RELOAD
# X_AMMO

# Output variables
# P_ALIVE
# P_FIRE

# Overview
On P_HIT, set P_ALIVE=0
On P_RESPAWN, set P_ALIVE=100
On P_RELOAD, set AMMO to X_AMMO
On P_ALIVE + P_TRIGGER, if AMMO > 0, AMMO -= 1 and P_FIRE=100

# Approach
1 controller for alive/dead
1 controller for ammo

It's been a while since doing this so going to jump into code...

# Initial solution
1 MX6000 for alive/dead
1 MX6000 for ammo
2 DX300

## Alive/dead
# If we are respawning
teq x0 010
  # Update alive state and write out to a pin
+ mov 100 acc
+ mov 100 p1

# If we are hit
teq x0 001
  # Update alive state and write out to a pin
+ mov 0 acc
+ mov 0 p1

# Sleep
slp 1

## Ammo
# If we are reloading, then reset our ammo count
# DEV: This comes before `reload` so we don't unwrite out `mov x3`
teq x3 010
+ mov x0 acc

# If we are firing, have ammo, and are alive, then fire (decrement + output fire)
teq x3 100
+ tgt acc 0
+ teq p0 100
  # DEV: Our `mov` is automatically reset the next second due to a read
+ mov 001 x3
+ sub 1

# Sleep
slp 1

## Second iteration
Same as before but with MX3000's. We need the DX300 for pins =/
