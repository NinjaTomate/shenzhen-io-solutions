# Input variables
# X_CARD_READER (non-blocking, i.e. -999)
# P_CASH_20
# P_CASH_50
# P_CASH_100

# Output variables
# X_NETWORK

# Overview
Buffer card to RAM
Total cash in ACC
On `-1` from card reader
  Flush card from RAM to X_NETWORK
  Flush cash (ACC) to X_NETWORK

# First iteration
## Gist
2 controllers

Cash counter
If signal === -999
JMP SLEEP

If signal === -1
MOV ACC 8
JMP OUTPUT_LOOP

Else
MOV ACC 7
JMP INPUT_LOOP

TODO: Need to see if we have enough lines for these 2 loops (prob not)
  If not, 3 controllers:
  - 1 to write card id to RAM + send -1 to next controller
  - 1 to read from RAM and flush cash via X pin
  - And cash reader

Read cash in via DX300
Flush cash via X pin
  - On X SIGNAL
  - Write ACC to X
  - Write 0 to ACC
