# Gist
Queue up senses in RAM or some other storage mechanism
Don't send senses until we have 2 or more
Don't resend a sent sense within 2s
Send senses in numerical order

I think hardest part is going to be layout due to all of the wires
  We could use DX300 and `dgt` but I dislike that

First thoughts before layout are:

1 controller reads in values, writes to RAM at sequenced locations
  Maybe store with an expiry value next to it?
  Let's not worry about sustained values for now
Another controller gets signal from initial reader and does same for 3,4,5
  Sends signal to outputter
Outputter looks over data, if there's at least 2 values, then it sends them in order. Using RAM index as value to send
