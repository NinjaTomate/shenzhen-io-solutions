# Overview
Data packets = 24 values + 1 checksum
  If checksm matches, send along data

  Should be activated every 5s
  When data packet received, activate pump and reset delay

  Validate checksum:
    Add first value
    Subtract second
    Add third
    Subtract fourth
    Etc
    Add checksum (25th)
  If sum = 0, valid. Else, nope

# Gist
Leverage X pins to queue data

Should be plausible with 2 small controllers

- 1 to do checksum
- 1 to receive queue on 1 pin with checksum pending on another
