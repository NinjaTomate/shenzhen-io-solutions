Collection of notes while playing/solving puzzles in Shenzhen I/O

## Documentation
Each of the `.txt` documents is my documentation while solving a level. At the end of each file should be a working solution.

**Other documents:**

While playing through the game, I decided to record some other notes for easier reference (I was using 2 monitors -- 1 for game, 1 for manual + notes). The documents are:

- `EMAILS.md` - Notes derived from messages in game (e.g. hidden instructions)
- `PERSONAL-NOTES.md` - Notes that I worked out on my own/discovered via forums
