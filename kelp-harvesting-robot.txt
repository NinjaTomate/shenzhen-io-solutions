# Input variables
X_RADIO_RX

# Output variables
P_MOTOR_X
P_MOTOR_Y
P_HARVEST

# Gist
Harvester location = `0, 0`
On radio signal
  Move to `x, y` (from signal)
  Need to look at verification for explanation on "at least one location" wording...

Diagonal moves should be possible

Helper: Will never get packet for `0, 0`
Helper: Will never have more than 6 locations
