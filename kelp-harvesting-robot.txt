P_HARVEST

# Overview
Harvester location = `0, 0`
On radio signal
  Queue up new position `x, y` (from signal)

When queue isn't empty
  Move to next position in queue and harvest

Diagonal moves should be made when possible

Helper: Will never get packet for `0, 0`
Helper: Will never have more than 6 pending locations

# Gist
1 controller to read signals into RAM (queue, address 1)
1 controller to read from RAM (queue, address 2)
  Sends signals to X movement, Y movement, and handle harvest personally
1 controller for X movement (X pin -> on + sleep for `n`)
1 controller for Y movement (X pin -> on + sleep for `n`)

We thought about having signals queue back/forth with reader but we will likely miss out on `slx` signals due to sleeps or something

TODO: Probably going to run into trouble with keeping track of position but let's see how this goes...
