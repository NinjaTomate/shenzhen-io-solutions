# Gist
Check signal
If signal is 1
  Walk through RAM until 0 slot found (subcontroller)
  Write ID to RAM slot
If signal is 2
  Walk through RAM until ID found
  Write 0 to RAM slot

# First attempt
## MC6000
# Wait for signal
slx x0

# If signal is < 1 (-999), jump to sleep
tcp
# If signal is > 1 (2), do LOAD motion
# Otherwise, (1), do SAVE motion

- Logic should be same for load/save except for extend at start/end
