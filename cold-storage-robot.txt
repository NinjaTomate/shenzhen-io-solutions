# Gist
Check signal
If signal is 1
  Walk through RAM until 0 slot found (subcontroller)
  Write ID to RAM slot
If signal is 2
  Walk through RAM until ID found
  Write 0 to RAM slot

# First attempt
## MC6000
# Wait for signal
slx x0

# If signal is < 1 (-999), jump to sleep
tcp
# If signal is > 1 (2), do LOAD motion
# Otherwise, (1), do SAVE motion

- Logic should be same for load/save except for extend at start/end

Initial thought is to store ids in RAM by looping which should work but we were worried about address

```
slx x0
mov x0 dat
loop:
teq x2 0
- jmp loop
mov 14 acc
loop2:
sub 1
mov
teq acc 0
- jmp loop2
```

Now we realize that's not an issue:

[id] [index] [id] [index]

Loop until [id] = [0]

....

Actually no `[index]` needed, `a0` is index

[id] [id]

Loop until [id] = [0]

Move `a0` to `acc`
Sub 1
Mov `acc` to `a0`
Save `id`
