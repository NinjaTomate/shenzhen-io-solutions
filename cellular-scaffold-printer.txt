# Input variables
X_DATA

# Output variables
P_MOTOR_X
P_MOTOR_Y
P_VALVE_ALPHA
P_VALVE_BETA
P_VALVE_PSI

# Gist
8 different pattern types
Get a 6 value packet that outputs different rows
Get -1 to reset printer position

This feels a lot like sandwich assembler...

Reset packet never arrives while print job is in progress

From past Reddit browsings, they said X inputs can be slept and not flushed. It looks like they are right o_o

# First iteration
Reading from queue works:

Started with a P pin but thinking it's more trouble than it's worth (saves us a register but do we need to yet?)

```
slp: slx x1
mov x1 acc
teq acc -1
+ mov 100 p1
+ jmp slp
mov acc p1
mov 5 acc
loop: slp 6
mov x1 p1
sub 1
teq acc 0
- jmp loop
```
