Use RAM for flags as ACC is bulky
Possibly use RAM?

Save flags on ACC as digits

Follow instructions procedurally

Use DX300 for multiplexing easily

# Code
Wait for signal

Initial thoughts were to use ACC
and then handle all instructions in single script
but going to be too bulky

so swapping to ram and this is an interim state

START:
# Wait for signal
slx x0

# Save input
mov x0 dat

# If we should start then send start signal
teq dat 3
+ mov 100 x2
# DEV: Jump to prevent touching memory
+ jmp START

# If we are at -1
teq dat -1
# Move to first option offset
+ mov 1 x0
# Set it to 0 (RAM jumps to next option -- i.e. 2)
+ mov 0 x3
# Set it to 0 also
+ mov 0 x3
# Otherwise, jump to option offset and set it
# DEV: Security flaw since it's outside input \o/
- mov dat x0
- mov 1 x3
