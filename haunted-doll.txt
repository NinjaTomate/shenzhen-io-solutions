# Gist
Read from random
If random is 1
  then play track 1
    Read from RAM 1
    DEV: We could use -1 terminators
      but going for 12 units is fine too
If random is 2
  then play track 2

# Code
Too many lines but gist is as above

# If play track 1
teq p0 1
  # Reset RAM 1
+ mov 0 x1
  # Play RAM 1
+ jmp LOOP1
teq p0 2
  # Reset RAM 2
+ mov 0 x3
  # Play RAM 2
+ jmp LOOP2
# Go to sleep (do nothing)
jmp SLEEP

LOOP1:
  mov x0 acc
  teq acc -1
  + jmp SLEEP
LOOP2:

SLEEP:
slp 1


teq p0 1
+ mov 100
+ jmp LOOP1
teq p0 2
+ mov 0 x3
+ jmp LOOP2
LOOP1:
  mov x0 acc
  teq acc -1
  + jmp SLEEP
LOOP2:

SLEEP:
slp 1

Tried a circuit with same speaker but realized normal is 50
  so that won't work
