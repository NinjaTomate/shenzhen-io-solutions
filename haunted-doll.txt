Read from random
If random is 1
  then play track 1
    Read from RAM 1
    DEV: We could use -1 terminators
      but going for 12 units is fine too
If random is 2
  then play track 2

# Code
Too many lines but gist is as above

# If play track 1
teq p0 1
  # Reset RAM 1
+ mov 0 x1
  # Play RAM 1
+ jmp LOOP1
teq p0 2
  # Reset RAM 2
+ mov 0 x3
  # Play RAM 2
+ jmp LOOP2
# Go to sleep (do nothing)
jmp SLEEP

LOOP1:
  mov x0 acc
  teq acc -1
  + jmp SLEEP
LOOP2:

SLEEP:
slp 1


teq p0 1
+ mov 100
+ jmp LOOP1
teq p0 2
+ mov 0 x3
+ jmp LOOP2
LOOP1:
  mov x0 acc
  teq acc -1
  + jmp SLEEP
LOOP2:

SLEEP:

Tried a circuit with same speaker but realized normal is 50
  so that won't work

Broken by if/else logic and not enough lines

TODO: Try out 1 controller to reset addresses
  and another to play back tracks

It works!

# If we have RANDOM = 1 or 2 (i.e. between 0 and 3)

+ tlt p0 3
# Tell controller 2 about new track to play
# DEV: This comes first as simple pins don't wait
+ mov p0 p1
# Reset positions on RAM
+ mov 0 x0
+ mov 0 x3
# Reset decrement counter
+ mov 14 acc
# If we are waiting for music to finish, count down
tgt acc 0
+ sub 1
# If music has stopped, tell controller 2 to stop
teq acc 0
+ mov 0 p1
# Wait
slp 1

# Controller 4 (MC4000)
