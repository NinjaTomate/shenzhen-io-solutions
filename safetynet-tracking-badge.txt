Ping and sector are in donut for some reason, let's unroll that...

|                   | SYNC_0 |  20 |  40 |  60 |  80 | 100 |
|-------------------|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 80 <= PING <= 100 |    100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| 50 <  PING <   80 |    600 | 200 | 201 | 202 | 203 | 204 |
| 0  <= PING <= 50  |    600 | 700 | 700 | 700 | 700 | 700 |

Logic which should work for ping/sync calc

# Complete row 80 <= PING <= 100
if PING >= 80 (i.e. > 79)
  set 100
  jmp SLEEP

# Complete column SYNC_0 (excluding first row)
if SYNC === 0
  set 600
  jmp SLEEP

# Complete row 0 <= PING <= 50 (excluding first column)
if PING <= 50 (i.e < 51)
  set 700
  jmp SLEEP

# Complete remaining 200 - 204 values
# Derive offset of 0, 1, ..., 4 for 200 from SYNC
acc = sync (e.g. 20, 40, ..., 100)
acc -= 20 (e.g. 0, 20, ..., 80)
dgt 1 acc (e.g. 0, 2, ..., 8)
  Ugh, how do we divide...
  Oh, simpler... loop and subtract until data is 0

acc = sync (e.g. 20, 40, ... 100)
acc -= 20 (initial offset) -- (e.g. 0, 20, ..., 80)
LOOP:
  if acc > 0:
    acc -= 21 (e.g. 0, -1, -2, ..., -4)
    LOOP
acc *= -1 (e.g. 0, 1, 2, ..., 4)
acc += 200 (e.g. 200, 201, 202, ..., 204)
set acc

We explored/verified that DX300 normalizes 50 to 100 and 49 to 0 so we won't need to worry about extra P pins

Nvm, we need it... fuck...

Oh, and we needed to output on X due to >= 100 anyway so nvm =P

---------

Cool, we got tracker working except for persisting ping signal
  We will likely need another controller for that since we are out of space

Logic is same as above

- 1 MC6000 for non-LOOP part
- 1 MC6000 for LOOP part

Both write to same X channel

**Non-LOOP:**

```
# If PING >= 80, send 100 and stop
tgt p0 79
+ mov 100 x3
+ jmp SLEEP

# If SYNC === 0, send 600 and stop
teq p1 0
+ mov 600 x3
+ jmp SLEEP

# If PING <= 50, send 700 and stop
tlt p0 51
+ mov 700 x3
+ jmp SLEEP

# Load SYNC into memory
mov p1 acc

# Subtract 20 (as part of logic)
sub 20
  # TODO: We can free up `sub 20` by adding `199` instead of `200` later one
     This is due to 21 offsets

# Forwrad adjusted SYNC
mov acc x2
SLEEP: slp 1
```

**LOOP:**

```
# Wait for signal
slx x2

# Load adjusted SYNC
mov x2 acc

LOOP:
# Remove -21 until going below 0
tgt acc 0
+ sub 21
+ jmp LOOP

# Recover -1 overflows as offset
mul -1

# Add to 200
add 200

# Export value
mov acc x3
```

----

Yep, as expected we could move `sub 20` into `add 200` by making it `add 199`
  which freed up more lines

We now have a straightforward PING tracker

```
# NEW: Save PING for future reference
tgt p0 0
+ mov p0 dat

# NEW: Load from saved PING instead of PING pin
tgt dat 79
+ mov 100 x3
+ jmp SLEEP
teq p1 0
+ mov 600 x3
+ jmp SLEEP

# NEW: Load from saved PING instead of PING pin
tlt dat 51
+ mov 700 x3
+ jmp SLEEP

# NEW: Write SYNC directly to `x2`
# DEV: This saves 1 pin for LOOP controller and let's it know when to start
mov p1 x2
SLEEP: slp 1
```

```
slx x2
mov x2 acc
LOOP:
tgt acc 0
+ sub 21
+ jmp LOOP
mul -1
# NEW: Use `add 199` to account for `20` being set to `-1` then `1`
#   and we want `200`
add 199
mov acc x3
```

-----

Added in a radio switch (e.g. different logic for 1 or 2)

Everything is looking great but want to record for now

- Same 2 LOOP items as before
- 1 MC4000 to forward badge number when request
- 1 MC6000 to read radio packets and trigger actions

Radio reader

```
# Reset speaker to 50
HEAD: mov 50 p1

# If packet is a badge request
# DEV: Signal for 1 and -999 other options but we can determine next via LENGTH
teq x0 2
  # and badge number matches
+ teq x0 x2
  # Let badge sender know to send badge for 1 second
+ gen p0 1 0
  # Jump to head (we already slept)
+ jmp HEAD

# Record length of speaker broadcast
mov x0 acc
LOOP:

# If we have more speaker broadcast to play
tgt acc 0
  # DEV: This section isn't yet working
  #   but reading concept is here...

  # Send speaker broadcast to speaker
+ mov x0 p1
# TODO: Need delay
#   Add RAM

  # Decrement and loop
+ sub 1
+ jmp LOOP

# Sleep
SLEEP: slp 1
```

Badge sender

```
# Wait for sector computation to finish
#  also acts as delay for `gen p0` to trigger in Radio reader
slx x0

# If we should send the sector number
teq p1 100
  # Then send it
+ mov x0 x1
  # Otherwise, flush sector number
- mov x0 null
```


TODO: For RAM, maybe always write out to 0th place and fill out with 50s

  Or have a controller that always reads from RAM every second and we reset it's address?
  Nah, that won't do a good reset...


TODO: Need to add -999 check and actually outut audio (3 lines)

--------

Got loop working but it looks like our radar missed a part -- we only update value on ping

But for now, let's record our audio logic...

Radio switch:

```
# If packet is a badge request
# DEV: Signal for 1 and -999 other options but we can determine next via LENGTH
teq x0 2
  # and badge number matches
+ teq x0 x3
  # Let badge sender know to send badge for 1 second
+ gen p0 1 0
  # Jump to sleep (we double sleep but it's fine)
+ jmp HEAD

# If we aren't reading audio, then sleep
teq x0 -999
+ jmp SLEEP

# Otherwise, overwrite all 14 values in RAM so it loops back to 0
#   and clears out stale data
mov 13 acc
LOOP:
mov x0 x1
tgt acc 0
+ sub 1
+ jmp LOOP

# Notify audio reader to read
mov 100 x2

# Sleep
SLEEP: slp 1
```

Audio reader:

```
# Reset speaker position to 50
RESET: mov 50 p1

# Wait for signal
slx x3

# Flush signal
mov x3 null

LOOP:
# Read from RAM
mov x0 acc

# If we hit end of RAM, go to reset (sets speaker back to 50)
teq acc -999
+ jmp RESET

# Otherwise, send audio to speaker
mov acc p1

# Wait 1 second
slp 1

# Continue looping
# DEV: This is flawed if there's over 14 values of data but seriously, fuck that.g
jmp LOOP
```

------

Level completed!

Final result:

- Non-LOOP tracker, MC6000 (needed for lines of logic)
    - Handles non-iterative portion of calculating location
- LOOP tracker, MC4000X
    - Handles iterative portion of calculating location
- Badge sender, MC6000 (needed for `dat` register)
    - Saves location and sends to radio when appropriate
- 1 RAM
- Radio reader, MC6000 (needed for lines and pins)
    - Reads radio packet, decides where to send them, and triggers other controllers (badge sender and audio reader)
- Audio reader, MC6000 (needed for lines)
    - Reads to audio from RAM, sends to speaker

Non-LOOP tracker

# Add to 199 to account for too much subtraction (instead of 200)
add 199

# Export value
mov acc x2
```

Badge sender:

```
# When we get a badge signal from tracker
# DEV: Happens every second so we don't miss `p` requests
#   Even when there isn't a change to tracker value
slx x0

# Save our tracker value

teq acc -1

# If there is a request for badge number, send it to RADIO_TX
