2 controllers

Use RAM

1 controller to writes data like [sonar_0, magnetic_0, sonar_1, magnetic_1, ...]
  it also cycles at 13th index so when we read, it's always oldest to most recent

Both controllers should either with same address pin
  or read a0 to a1 at loop start on read

Other controller checks ID
  If ID bad, sleep
  Load a0 into ACC
  If reading magnetic
    Add 1
  Set ACC to a1
  # Read every 2nd
  Export RAM info to TX
  Export RAM info to NULL
