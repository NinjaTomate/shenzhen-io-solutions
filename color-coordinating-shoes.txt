## Thoughts
Need to figure out how to get most common color

Once we have it, convert it to an index (7 indicies)

Read N/K from read only RAM [N_0, K_0, N_1, K_1, ...]

Maybe we convert to index and set RAM value at index

Then on release we perform reads
  But how do we know which one won...
  I guess >= and overwrite `dat` or something
    Also no ties so `>` only

TODO: Need to start at neutral

## Concept
3 controllers:

- Button press detector + RAM writer
    - When button off, send X trigger with NULL to next controller
- Common color calculator
    - On NULL signal from button press detector
    - Read from RAM, use >= to find best index
    - Send X trigger with index to next controller
- Color outputer
    - Jump to read only RAM at specified index
    - Flush next 2 values as N and K
    - Maybe swap order so its (K, N) like diagram
