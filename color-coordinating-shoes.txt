## Thoughts
Need to figure out how to get most common color

Once we have it, convert it to an index (7 indicies)

Read N/K from read only RAM [N_0, K_0, N_1, K_1, ...]

Maybe we convert to index and set RAM value at index

Then on release we perform reads
  But how do we know which one won...
  I guess >= and overwrite `dat` or something
    Also no ties so `>` only

TODO: Need to start at neutral

## Concept
3 controllers:

- Button press detector + RAM writer
    - When button off, send X trigger with NULL to next controller
- Common color calculator
    - On NULL signal from button press detector
    - Read from RAM, use >= to find best index
    - Send X trigger with index to next controller
- Color outputer
    - Jump to read only RAM at specified index
    - Flush next 2 values as N and K
    - Maybe swap order so its (K, N) like diagram

TODO: Use DX300 + MC4000X for last controller to save cost and pins?

TODO: We can also convert P_BUTTON to X_BUTTON via DX300
  but space seems limited

### Mapping logic
20-39 -> 2 or 3 -> -1 or 0
40-49 -> 4 -> 1
50-59 -> 5 -> 2
60-69 -> 6 -> 3
70-79 -> 7 -> 4
80-89 -> 8 -> 5

Need to verify: Moving RAM address to -1 moves to 0
  Nope, it jumps to -1 index (in fact, -100 is -2 === -100 modulo 14)
  Thankfully, we should be fine to only use this logic on save
  So either use a `< -1` check or `< 40` check...

TODO: We might not need to X trigger from first controller to second
  We could have second watch button too
