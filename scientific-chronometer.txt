- Initially device is off
- Turn on by pressing start/stop once
- Once device is on, press start/stop to start counter
- Counter is +1 for every 2 time units on
- On P_RESET_OFF press:
    - If not running and > 0, reset to 0
    - If not running and = 0, turn off
    - If running, ignored

TODO: If we need to save input PINs we can use a DX300

Various thoughts:

- Could have an always running counter with a reset signal (due to 2 time units being weird)
- Will likely need to maintain running state in 1 controller
    - It should read current count from another controller via `P_` flag if possible
