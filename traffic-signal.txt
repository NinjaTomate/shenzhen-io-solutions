# Input variables
# P_EMERGENCY
# X_PHASE_0
# X_PHASE_1
# X_PHASE_2

# Output variables
# P_LIGHT_0
# P_LIGHT_1
# P_LIGHT_2

# Overview
Show light 1
Show light 2
Show light 3

If emergency is enabled, cancel all others

# First iteration
## Gist
Turn on P_LIGHT_0
Sleep X_PHASE_0
Turn on P_LIGHT_1
Sleep X_PHASE_1
Turn on P_LIGHT_2
Sleep X_PHASE_2

AND each of P_LIGHT_* with ! P_EMERGENCY

TODO: How to solve extra pin X and P pin...

Elegant solution

Microcontroller to write out phases to RAM

Then READ from RAM and loop

Still no simple solution for 3rd P pin

Oh, right DX300

## Code
- 1 MC4000X
- 1 inverter
- 1 DX300
- 3 AND gates

```
# Turn on LIGHT_0
mov 100 x3
# Sleep for PHASE_0
slp x0
# Turn on LIGHT_1
mov 010 x3
# Sleep for PHASE_1
slp x1
# Turn on LIGHT_2
mov 001 x3
# Sleep for PHASE_2
slp x2
```

Unfortunately it doesn't work due to sequence restarting =(

# Second iteration

Phase change observer
Phase change lighter

Observer:

If emergency
  Reset counter to phase 0
  Send -1 to lighter (or use AND gates to neutralize)
  TODO: Add 1 for later decrement? or use jump SLEEP
# DEV: This will run in emergency
If looping over last phase
  Decrement
  Jump SLEEP

... How do I know which phase comes next =_=
