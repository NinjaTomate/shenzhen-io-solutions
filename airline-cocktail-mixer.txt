Seems like meat printer v2

Considering if we can only write to vodka and gin mutually exclusively

Prob going to need DX300 and some clever RAM storage

Maybe duplexer for keypad info to 2 controller
  1 for top 3 items
  1 for bottom 3 items

Maybe something like

311 to indicate 3 units vodka, 1 unit gin, 1 unit lemon (0.5oz = unit)
  (although vodka + gin are mutually exclusive, we have scenario in bottom 3)

For 3 top, we can prob do
  If 311 over 100, then 200 (i.e. -111)
  What's DST of negative values again? It wraps...

Simplest form is:

Load data into `dat`
Calculate 1's for DX300
  Load data into `acc`
  Retrieve 1's place
  If over 0
    Load data into `acc`
    Decrement by 1 (would need to figure out how to get 10)
      Maybe another controller...
    Save `acc` to data
    Set 1's place to 1 somehow for DX300
  Else:
    Set 0's place to 1 somehow for DX300
Loop for 10's and 100's place
If data > 0, sleep + loop

Okay, let's do that again -- this time where we know there's a second controller which track DX300 value

First controller:

Load data into `dat`
(acc = 0 by default, maybe need to reset)
LOOP:
  Load data into `acc`
  Send position to NEXT CONTROLLER
  Retrieve 1's place (acc)
  Send 1's place to NEXT CONTROLLER
  Load data into `acc`
  Subtract amount specified by NEXT CONTROLLER
    This will be index * 1/0
      How will NEXT CONTROLLER calculate this without losing their `acc`
      Maybe they need a `dat` value (MC6000)

How the hell do we loop this if we are using `acc`?

Enough thought... let's try this...
