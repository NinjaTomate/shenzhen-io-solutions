Seems like meat printer v2

Considering if we can only write to vodka and gin mutually exclusively

Prob going to need DX300 and some clever RAM storage

Maybe duplexer for keypad info to 2 controller
  1 for top 3 items
  1 for bottom 3 items

Maybe something like

311 to indicate 3 units vodka, 1 unit gin, 1 unit lemon (0.5oz = unit)
  (although vodka + gin are mutually exclusive, we have scenario in bottom 3)
