# Gist
1 router controller
3 controllers for each type

Need to figure out how to handle concurrent outputs...

# Exploration
After some exploring, it looks like 1 DX300 works well for type switches and we can barely fit 1 + 3 controllers

So the router will also need to control A/B

Maybe we can leverage a DX300 with the lookup controllers too?

Nah, that won't be possible as we need exact values

We got a layout working but realizing that the logic for router will be hard since it's not a single source response

```
mov x0 acc
teq acc -999
+ jmp slp
teq acc 2
+ mov
+ jmp slp
tcp acc 2
-
slp: slp 1
```

Maybe write all config to RAM, then let main controller jump to index and read RAM info

RAM won't work great as we don't have sleeper intervals...

Maybe instead of doing routing, we do multicasting and listen to a single X pin?

```
mov x0 dat
teq dat -999
+ jmp slp
mov 2 acc
loop: mov dat x1
teq x1 1
- jmp sub
teq x1 1
+
-
sub: sub 1
teq acc 0
- jmp loop
slp: slp 1
```

Ran out of lines of code, going to try 2 controllers...
