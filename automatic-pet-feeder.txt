# Gist
1 router controller
3 controllers for each type

Need to figure out how to handle concurrent outputs...

# Exploration
After some exploring, it looks like 1 DX300 works well for type switches and we can barely fit 1 + 3 controllers

So the router will also need to control A/B

Maybe we can leverage a DX300 with the lookup controllers too?

Nah, that won't be possible as we need exact values
